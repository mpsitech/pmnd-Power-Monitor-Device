# Power Monitor Device

This repository holds the low-level hardware C code and a matching C++ accessor library, a WhizniumDBE-backed project, for Power Monitor, a battery-powered high-side current measurement device based on the SiLabs UniversalBee platform.

When embedded with WhizniumSBE-backed software, specifically its monitoring _capability_, fine-grained time-resolved power efficiency charaterization of algorithms can be carried out.
